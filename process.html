             <p id="columnP" style="font-size: 20px; margin-left:110px; margin-right:110px;">I often here people caliming to not be creative. A lot of people may think that creativity is just something they are just born with. To an extend I think that's true. Some are naturally more creative than other. However, I know everyone is creative, they just might not realize it. Everyone is creative in their own unique way. There are many way to be creative and it doesn't always have to look the same. When people thing of creative they often automaticly just think of art and artistic people. However, creativity can be seen in all aspects of life.</p>

             <p  style="font-size: 20px; margin-left:110px; margin-right:110px">"Creativity is both a skill and a process. It's something you can learn. And like any other skill, it's something you can get bettter at through practice and repeated use." Creativity doesn't always have to involve creating soemthing, it can be used and seen in practical every day situations. People use creativity more than they might think. For example, to solve a problem or conflic at work one would use creative thinking to find a solution.
