      <h2>Photography</h2>
      <p>I have used the creative process throughout my time studying at Boise State. An example can be seen in my photogrphy.
          Sometimes I just go out to shoot pictures, I have no idea of what I want to capture but something usually catches my 
          eye. For example, the series of photos of buildings around Boise. I went out just looking to take pictures but became
           interested in the way the old buildings looked. I could see how our environment has left a visual mark on these buildings. 
           Just taking one picture made me interested in creating a series of how nature can be seen even in the middle of a busy city.

      <h2>Creative Process</h2>
      <p> According to the article <a id="link2" href="https://www.masterclass.com/articles/how-to-improve-creativity">How to Improve Creativity</a>, there are about five stages in the creative process. 
           Those five stages are Preparation, Incubation, Illumination, and Verification.  </p>
           <p>1. Preparation is when you start thinking of an idea and brainstorming. This is the stage of trying to find that spark of inspiration. </p>
            <p>2. Incubation is the stage of taking a step back from the project at hand. In this stage you allow yourself to take a breather and not over think about the project. Stepping away from the project can allow you the space you need to let the creativity flow.</p>
                <p> 3. Illumination is the third stage, which is when everything clicks and you form a connection to make your idea work. This is the stage where your solution is found.</p>
                    <p>4. Evaluation stage is when you test the viability of your new idea. This is when you decide if it really is a good solution to your problem.</p>
                        <p>5. Verification, the last stage is when you get to work and bring your idea to life. </p>

      <h2>Video</h2>
      <p>One way in which I have used the creative process through videography is by trying to look at things from a new perspective. Videos bring things to life and can capture feelings and emotions. I try to look to tell a story through my videos. Bellow are some examples of a few videos I've taken while traveling around the west coast. I like adding creative touches to videos like filming them from a different angle or adding affects like slow-mo.    </p>
